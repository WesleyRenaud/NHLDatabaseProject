## Overview ##

 * This project is a database of NHL data, specifically regarding players' and teams' stats of history.
 * The goal of the program is to provide availability to extra forms of data, and present data in ways
   in which it is currently difficult to find (i.e. new ways to sort data, find leaders in categories,
   etc.)
 * The project is a work in progress with most functionality still to be added

## Current Focus ##

* The current focus on the project is about uploading players' data to test out functionality regarding
  the team leaders and league leaders components of the program.

## Current Functionality ##

 * Team stats leaders (stats are only recorded for certain teams, and are not necessarily updated, some
   mistakes within the stats still exist)

## Resources ##
